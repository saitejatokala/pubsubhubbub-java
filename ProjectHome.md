### Overview ###

[PubSubHubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) is an open protocol for distributed Publish/subscribe communication on the internet. The protocol extends the [Atom](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt) and RSS protocols for data feeds. The main purpose is to provide near-instant notifications of change updates, which would improve on the typical situation where a client periodically polls the feed server at some arbitrary interval.

You can find more information of the project in the [PubSubHubbub Google site](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)
